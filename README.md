# EDA & Data Preprocessing on Google App Store Rating Dataset.
Approach: Train-Test Split and Cross-Validation: Begin by dividing the Google App Store Rating Dataset into training and testing sets, using techniques like k-fold cross-validation to iteratively assess the model's performance on different subsets, ensuring generalizability.Feature Scaling, Encoding, and Imputation: Preprocess the data by standardizing numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values. This prepares the dataset for machine learning models, ensuring uniformity and completeness during both training and testing phases.
Tools: Python(Jupyter Notebook)
Key Skills: Train-Test Split, Cross-Validation, Feature Scaling, Encoding, Data Imputation, Outlier Detection, Data Balancing.
